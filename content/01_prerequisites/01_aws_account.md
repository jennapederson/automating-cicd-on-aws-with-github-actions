You can complete this workshop at an AWS event where a temporary account is provided for you or as a self-guided workshop on your own, in your own AWS account.

### Using a Temporary AWS Account

If you're completing this workshop as part of an organized AWS event, you'll be provided a temporary AWS account. At the bottom of this workshop page, you'll see the following section to get you started.

Next, you'll be presented with the EventEngine dashboard. Here, you can click the "AWS Console" button and then click the "Open AWS Console" button to access the AWS Management Console.

##### Using Your Own AWS Account?

If you are not completing this workshop as part of an organized event and already have an AWS account created, you can sign into the AWS Management Console [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/). If you need to create an AWS account, you can find more information on doing that [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).

### AWS Free Tier

Wherever possible, AWS infrastructure which is part of the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), is used in this workshop.

Now that you have access to the AWS Management Console, we can get started automating CI/CD on AWS with GitHub Actions!
