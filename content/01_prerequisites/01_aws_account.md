You can complete this workshop at an AWS event where a temporary account is provided for you or in your own AWS account.

### Using Your Own AWS Account?

If you are not completing this workshop as part of an organized event and already have an AWS account created, you can sign into the AWS Management Console [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/). If you need to create an AWS account, you can find more information on doing that [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).

You may have been issued an AWS credit code to cover basic charges and encourage you to keep learning after this workshop is over. You can apply the credit code we issued you by clicking the "click here" link highlighted in the screenshot below.

Next, you'll be presented with the EventEngine dashboard. Here, you can click the "AWS Console" button and then click the "Open AWS Console" button to access the AWS Management Console.

### AWS Free Tier

Wherever possible, AWS infrastructure which is part of the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), is used in this workshop.

Now that you have access to the AWS Management Console, we can get started automating CI/CD on AWS with GitHub Actions!
