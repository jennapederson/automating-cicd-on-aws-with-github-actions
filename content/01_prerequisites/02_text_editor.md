You'll need access to a text editor for this workshop. This instructions assumes the use of Visual Studio Code (VS Code), but Sublime Text, Atom, or TextWrangler will also work. Text editors like these have development tools built in and will give you some hints along the way.

TextEdit and NotePad are not recommended for this workshop.

You can download and install Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
