# Automating CI/CD on AWS with GitHub Actions

### Welcome!

In this workshop, we'll show organizations using GitHub as a source code repository can use GitHub Actions to build a complete CI/CD pipeline for applications deployed on Amazon ECS. This workshop also illustrates how AWS CodeBuild can be used with GitHub Actions to execute application tests as part of a complete CI/CD pipeline.
